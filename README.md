## Introduction

This repository houses the source data used to create Tableau dashboards that provide insightful visualizations and analyses. The Tableau dashboards are designed to help users explore and understand the data through interactive features.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the `data` directory. This directory includes:

- `netflix_titles.csv`: The CSV data file contains information about various shows, with columns including the unique show ID, type (e.g., movie or TV show), title, director, cast, country of origin, date added to the platform, release year, rating, duration, the category it is listed in, and a brief description of the show. This dataset is useful for analyzing trends in show releases, exploring content by various attributes, and performing comprehensive content analysis.

This dataset is ideal for analyzing housing market trends, property valuations, and geographic distribution of real estate features.

This dataset is useful for analyzing Airbnb market trends, host activity, geographic distribution of listings, and rental pricing strategies.

This dataset is ideal for analyzing sales performance, market trends, and profitability across different regions and product categories.
- `FDI data.csv`: The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) data CSV file captures sector-wise investment details over the years 2000 to 2017, with columns indicating the sector and the corresponding annual investment amounts. This dataset is valuable for analyzing trends in FDI, identifying growth sectors, and understanding investment patterns over time.

Each data file contains raw data that has been cleaned and prepared for visualization in Tableau.
